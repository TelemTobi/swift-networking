/// The `JsonMapper` protocol is designed for components responsible for handling incoming JSON responses.

/// ### Usage
/// Implement this protocol to define custom logic for resolving or modifying incoming data.
/// If the transformation fails, throw `Networking.Error.mappingError` to indicate a mapping failure.

    /// - Returns: The processed data, ready for further use.
    /// - Throws: An error is thrown if the transformation or validation fails.
